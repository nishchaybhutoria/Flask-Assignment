# Flask-Assignment

Note that this assignment is incomplete. 

First, run `process.py`. This converts the PDF files to CSV files.
Next, run `load_csv.py`. This creates a database with the CSV files. Make sure you change the details to fit your data. I also removed my password before submitting for privacy.
Finally, run `main.py`.
